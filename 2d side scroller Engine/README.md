# Ummm...WhatDoYouWantToCallIt
 
This is a game engine for 2d top down games.
You can move with W S A D.

This project is in the pre-alpha stage of development which means you cannot really use it right now.
If you want to see what the game engine part does run the Game_Engine.py located in the Game Engine folder.
You will see a bunch of coordinates and if you use the controls you will see those coordinates change.

The Game Engine folder has things related to the functionality of the game,
The Test folder will probably never have anything in it but it is for us to test features and functions,
The images folder houses all the images that will be in the game, including animations, textures and more. (Currently only has the character - a red square)

PS: This Engine is called "Ummm...WhatDoYouWantToCallIt" because we were trying to come up with a name for it and we just kept asking each other that.
